# Next.js Project Starter

This script helps you quickly set up a new project using the [Next.js Project Template](https://github.com/tomek-i/nextjs-project-template). It automates the process of creating a new project based on the template repository.

## Installation

You can run the script globally using `npx`.

### Run the following command:

```bash
npx @tomek-i/nextjs-starter <project-name>
```

## Usage

1. **Create a new project**:  
   Run the script with a project name to set up your new Next.js project based on the template.

   Example:

   ```bash
   npx @tomek-i/nextjs-starter my-new-project
   ```

2. **Project structure**:  
    After running the script, you'll have a new Next.js project with the same structure and configuration as the [template](https://github.com/tomek-i/nextjs-project-template).

3. **Development**:  
    Once the setup is complete, navigate into your project folder and run the development server:

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

4. **Ready for customization**:  
    Now you're ready to customize and start building your application with the Next.js template.
